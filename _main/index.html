        <h1>Web Dev Snippets</h1>
        <h2>One Stop for all web development needs</h2>
        <p>This website is meant to help me document my learnings, at the same time, make it easier for me to develop future web applications. 
            The idea is simple, as I build more application, I would have more code snippets. The first time I try to implement something, chances
            are that I have to search around for implementation details. If I capture all the implementation details and references/resources here, I would eventually 
            be able to quickly create something from nothing, i.e. make a template out of all the past code that I've written.
